The idea of the UsabILIty Hub is to receive additional information for implemented INTERLIS models automatically via the web. Just as we can get models by linking the ilimodels.xml file from http://models.interlis.ch and the linked repositories, we can get the additional information with the ilidata.xml file on the UsabILIty Hub (currently https://models.opengis.ch) and the linked repositories. Settings for tools are configured in a metaconfiguration file, as well as links to topping files that contain information about GIS project (such as symbologies or legend structures). Thus, this additional information usually consists of a metaconfiguration and any number of toppings.


## Catalogues

Tell about the catalogues linked in the ilidata.xml - this is linked in the user guide at the data import page.
